                Our application for mobile devices enables users to keep track of many aspects of our buses. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It provides features such as the current location of each bus, the estimated time of arrival, the current capacity of each bus, requesting a stop at the user’s current bus stop, as well as frequent updates on the selected bus. 
                <br>
                <br>
                If ever the bus the user is expecting has suspected that the maximum capacity will be reached before it arrives to the selected bus stop, our app will alert the user about the state of the bus and the estimated arrival time of the express bus sent by our team.

                Many accessibility features exist to aid those in need of accommodation. The door located at the front of each bus is for use only by those with disabilities. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Through the app, there will be an option to purchase an accessibility pass which will have a different QR code than a regular ticket to be able to open the front door designated for users with assistive devices. This pass will lower the ramp and leave the doors open for a longer period compared to the back doors to give people ample of time to get on the bus. 
                <br>
                <br>
                There is also cooperative seating to give priority seats to those who are in need.

                A stop button is present at all TurboTranspo bus stops. This enables those who do not have access to the app a way to request stops at their current bus stop. We have included this feature to ensure our buses do not leave any riders behind in case the detectors on the front of the bus have a malfunction. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When purchasing a ticket through the app, the user will have the option to let the bus know the user is at the chosen station as well as set their desired drop-off stop before they board the bus. 	
                <br>
                <br>
                But do not be alarmed, our buses will still have the usual pulling the string and pushing the stop button available to those who chose to not use the app.

                TurboTranspo buses have access to private roads, along with utilizing public roads. This enables much faster transit for many routes and maintaining access to all the locations in high demand.

                In the event of an emergency, each TurboTranspo bus is outfitted with an emergency stop button. Activating it causes the bus to come to halt and send an alert message to the control center where we will be able to remotely control the bus from there if a malfunction in the operation takes place. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, inappropriate use of the emergency button will result in fines.

                The turnstiles on each back door on the buses will have a built in timer: everytime a rider comes in, the timer will restart the 7 seconds. When the last rider gets on, the timer will run out and the bus will know it is free to depart. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The turnstiles will be used to determine how many people are on the bus to be able to notify the app users whether their bus will be full by the time it gets to them. Each spin going clockwise will add one passenger to the counter and each spin going counter clockwise will remove one. This way, our system will be notified when the maximum capacity on each bus is almost met so our operators can send out the express bus.
