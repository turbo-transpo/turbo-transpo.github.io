Overall look and feel of Turbo Transpo

◦ Menu bar at the top with the logo in the left top corner
◦ Fonts from Google Fonts: Onest, EB Garamond, and Montserrat
◦ Colors: #FFFFFF, #78F9FF, #8CFBAE
◦ Black text
◦ Button style: no border, rounded/semi-square, not 3d ( if we were to have buttons on the page itself other than inside the menu bar)


All buttons should be the same (no borders, rounded, not 3D)
Drop down menu at the top should then create another drop down menu for sub sections when hovered over (instead of subsections being on the section)
Code drop down menu with JS

If links are to be used, they will be underlined with a shadow behind once hovered over
